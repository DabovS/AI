# Primer Concepts
Since the invention of computers or machines, their capability to perform various tasks has experienced an exponential growth. Humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms of their diverse working domains, their incresing speed, and reducing size with respect to time.

A branch of Computer Science named Artificial Intelligence pursues creating the computers or machines as intelligent as human beings.

## Basic Concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is "The sceince and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs". 

Artificail Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner to intelligent human think. AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the ourcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.

While exploiting the power of AI started with intention of creating similar intelligence in machines that we find and regard high in humans.

## The Necessity of Learning AI
As we know that AI purues creating the machines as intelligent as human beings. There are numerous reasons for us to study AI. The reasons are as follows -

### AI can learn through data
In our daily life, we deal with huge amount of data and human brain cannot keep track of so much data. That is why we need to automate the things. For doing automation, we need to study AI because it can learn from data and can do the repetitive tasks with accuracy and without tiredness.

### AI can teach itself
It is very necessary that a system should teach itself because the data itself keeps changing and the knowledge which is derived from such data must be updated constantly. We can use AI to fulfill this purpose because an AI enabled system can teach itself.

### AI can respond in real time
Artificial intelligence with the help of neural networks can analyze the data more deeply. Due to this capability, AI can think and respond to the situations which are based on the conditions in real time.

### AI achieves accuracy
With the help of deep neural networks, AI can acieve tremendous accuracy. AI helps in the field of medicine to diagnose diseases such as cancer from the MRIs of patients.

### AI can organize data to get most out of it
The data is an intellectual property for the system which are using self-learning algorithms. We need AI to index and organize the data in a way that it always gives the best results.

### Understanding Intelligence
With AI, smart systems can be built. We need to undestand the concept of intelligence so that our brain can construct another intelligence system like itself.

## What is Intelligence?
The ability of a system to calculate, reason, perceive relationships and analogies, learn from experience, store and retrieve information from memory, solve problems, comprehend complex ideas, use natural language fluently, classify, generalize, and adapt new situations.

| Sr.No | Intelligence & Description | Example |
--- | --- | --- |
|1 | **Linguistic intelligence**. The ability to speak, recognize, and use mechanisms of phonology (speech sounds), syntax (grammar), and semantics (meaning). | Narrators, Operators | 
| 2 | **Musical intelligence**. The ability to create, communicate with, and undestand meanings made of sound, understanding of pitchm rhythm. | Musicians, Singers, Composers |
| 3 | **Logical-mathemetical intelligence**. The ability to use and undestand relationships in the absence of action or objects. It is also the ability to understand complex and abstract ideas. | Mathematicians, Scientists |
| 4 | **Spatial intelligence**. The ability to perceive visual or spacial information, change it, and re-create visual images without reference to the objects, construct 3D images, and to move and rotate them. | Map readers, Astronauts, Physicists |
| 5 | **Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence**. The abiility to use complete or part of the body to solve problems or fashion products, control over fine and coarse motor skills, and manipulate the objects. | Players, Dancers |
| 6 | **Intra-personal intelligence**. The ability to distinguish among one's own feelings, intentions, and motivations. | Gautam Buddhha |
| 7 | **Interpersonal intelligence**. The ability to recognize and make distinctions among other people's feelings, beliefs, and intentions. | Mass Communicators, Interviewers |

You can say a machine or a system is artificially intelligent when it is equipped with a least one or all intelligence in it.

## What is Intelligence Composed Of?
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of:

* Reasonning
* Learning
* Problem Solving 
* Perception
* Linguistic Intelligence

![Figure 1 - Intelligence](01.Intelligence.png)

### Reasoning
It is the set of processes that enables us to provide besis for judgement, making decisions, and prediction. There are broadly two types:

1. **Inductive Reasoning**

* It conducts specific observations to makes broad general statements. 
* Even if all of the premises are true in a statement, inductive reasoning allows for the conclusion to be false.

**Example**: "Nita is a teacher, Nita is studious. Therefore, All teachers are studious." 

2. **Deductive Reasoning**

* It starts with a general statement and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion.
* If something is true of a class of things in general, it is also true for all members of that class.

**Example**: "All women of age above 60 years are grandmothers. Shalini is 65 years. Therefore, Shalini is a grandmother."

### Learning - 1
The ability of learning is prossessed by humans, particular species of animals, and AI-enabled systems. Learning is categorized as follows:

1. **Auditory Learning**

* It is learning by listening and hearing. For example, students listening to recorded audio lectures.

2. **Episodic Learning**

* To learn by remembering sequences of events that one has witnessed or experienced. This is linear and orderly.

3. **Motor Learning**

* It is learning by precise movement of muscles. For example, picking objects, writing, etc.

4. **Observational Learning**

* To learn by watching and imitating others. For example, child tries to learn by mimicking her parent.

5. **Perceptual Larning**

* It is learning to recognize stimuli that one has seen before. For example, identifying and classifying objects and situations.

6. **Relational Learning**

* It involves learning to differentiate among various stimuli on the basis of relational properties, rather than absolute properties. For Example, Adding 'little less' salt at the time of cooking potatoes that came up salty last time, when cooked with adding say a tablespoon of salt.

    * **Spatial Learning** - It is learning through visual stimuli such as images, colors, maps, etc. For example, A person can create roadmap in mind before actually following the road.
    * **Stimulus-Response Learning** - It is learning to perform a particular behavior when a certain stimulus is present. For example, a dog raises its ear on hearing doorbell.

7. **Problem Solving**

* It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a desired solution from a present situation by taking some path, which is blocked by known or unknown hurdles.
* Problem solving also includes **decision making**, which is the process of selecting the best suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal. 

8. **Perception**

* It is the process of aquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information.
* Perception presumes **sensing**. In humans, perception is aided by sensory organs. In the domain of AI, perception mechanism puts the data aquired by the sensors together in a meaningful manner.

9. **Linguistic Intelligence**

* It is one's ability to use, comprehend, speak, and write the verbal and written language. It is important in interpersonal communication.

## What's Involved in AI
Artificial intelligence is a vast area of study. This field of study helps in finding solutions to real world problems. Let us now see the different fields of study within AI:

1. **Machine Learning**

* It is one of the most popular fields of AI. The basic concept of this field is to make the machine learning from data as the human beings can learn from his/her experience. It contains learning models on the basis of which the predictions can be made on unknown data.

2. **Logic**

* It is another important field of study in which mathematical logic is used to execute the computer programs. It contains rules and facts to perform pattern matching, semantic analysis, etc.

3. **Searching**

* This field of study is basically used in games like chess, tic-tac-toe. Search algorithms give the optimal solution after searching the whole search space.

4. **Artificial neural networks**

* This is a network of efficient computing systems the central theme of which is borrowed from the analogy of biological neural networks. ANN can be used in robotics, speech recognition, speech processing, etc.

5. **Genetic Algorithm**

* Genetic algorithms help in solving problems with the assistance of more than one program. The result would be besed on selectinmg the fittest.

6. **Knowledge Representation**

* It is the field of study with the help of which we can represent the facts in a way the machine that is undestandable to the machine. The more efficiently knowledge is represented, the more system would be intelligent.

## Application of AI

    * A spying aeroplane takes photohraphs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.
    * Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.
    * Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist.

5. **Speech Recognition**

* Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending thelanguage in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human's noise due to cold, etc.

6. **Handwriting Recognition**

* The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.

7. **Intelligent Robots**

* Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and presure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and the can adapt to the new environment. 

## Cognitive Modeling: Simulating Human Thinking Procedure
Cognitive modeling is basically the field of study within computer science that edals with the study and simulating the thinking process of human beings. The main task of AI is to make machine think like human. The most important feature of human thinking process is problem solving. That is why more or less cognitive modeling tries to undestand how humans can solve the problems. After that this model can be used for various AI applications such as machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, etc. Following is the diagram of different thinking levels of human brain:

![Figure 02 - Different thinking levels](./02.Brain.png)

## Agent & Environment
In this section, we will focus on the agent and environment and how these help in Artificial Intelligence.

### Agent
An agent is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through effectors.

* A **human agent** has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin parallel to the sensors, and other organs such as hand, legs, mouth, for effectors. 
* A **robotic agent** replaces cameras and intrared range finders for the sensors, and various motors and actuators for effectors. 
* A **software agent** has encoded bit strings as its programs and actions. 

### Environment
Some programs operate in an entirely **artificial environment** confined to keyboard input, database, computer file systems and character output on a screen. 

In contrast, some software agents (software robots or softbots) exist in rich, unlimited softbots domains. The simulator has a **very detailed, complex environment**. The software agent needs to choose from a long array of actions in real time. A softbot is designed to scan online preferences of the customer and shows interesting items to the customer works in the **real** as well as an **artificial** environment.
